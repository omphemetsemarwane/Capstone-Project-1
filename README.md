# Project information:
# Description
The Financial Calculator is a Programme written in Python programming language. This 'Financial Calculator' was designed for use by a small financial company to allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. 

# Features(How it works)

This program firstly display a menu to the user with two options of finance calculators they can choose(an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator). Investment calculator is used to calculate the return on investment. Bond calculate is used to calculate the repayment on home loan. 

Based on which calculator the user chooses, the programme will then ask user for input with different questions. The information from the user's input will be captured and used to calculate either their monthly bond repayments for a set time period, or total investment value over a certain number of years

EXAMPLE:
If the user chooses the investment calculator, they will be asked to enter:

> The amount of money that they are depositing
> The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered — don’t worry about having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user should enter 8     and not 8%
> The number of years they plan on investing for
> Whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest

The program then calculates the final investment amount based on the information from the user and print out the results in an easy-to-read manner. 

If the user chooses the bond calculator, they will be asked to enter:

> The present value of the house
>  The interest rate
>  The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond

The program then calculates the The amount that a person will have to be repaid on a home loan each month in an easy-to-read manner.

# How to use this Financial Calculator

* To run this programme, you need to download the Python programme onto your computer operating system so that this Financial Calculator can be exercuted. 
* Link to download Python on your computer(e.g Mac, Linux, Windows etc.) https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Once Python is downloaded, you need IDLE(An Intergrated Development Environment). IDLE is a safe environment to view and run your code. Python comes with built-in IDLE that     can be accessed easily by opening the IDLE files from the program with the Python interpreter. 
* Once IDLE is opened it will display a "Shell" window, from the window, click "File", then click "Open" from the Toolbar(top of the Window) to open the Financial Calculator.
* To run the Financial Calculator, click "Run" from the top Toolbar and check the output that shows in the Python shell Window. 
* You will be asked to input information to select a calculator
